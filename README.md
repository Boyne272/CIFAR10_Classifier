## Repository Structure

- corsework_brief.ipynb is the document we were given describing the task (un-edited)
- ACSE8_CW3.ipynb has all the tasks completed, annotated and has been re-run to ensure no bugs
- CIFAR10_classifier.pth is a pickeled model object (the whole object, not just its parameters) of the LeNet5 model trained on the entire CIFAR10 training data set with a test accuracy of 62.6%

## Notes to the Examiner

Thanks for marking, hope my comments are clear and concise. If you are planning on running the notebook again care is needed with regard to the google drive connection and the saving of the model (sections 0 and 8). 

As always here is an appropriate meme
